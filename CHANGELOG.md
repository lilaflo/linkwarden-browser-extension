## Development Notes

### Tag Creation Fix (1.4.0)
The major breakthrough in this version was analyzing the Linkwarden source code to understand the exact API requirements:

**Before (Broken):**
```json
{ "name": "tag-name" }
```

**After (Working):**
```json
{
  "tags": [
    { "label": "tag-name" }
  ]
}
```

This structural difference was why collections worked but tags failed - collections use direct objects while tags require a wrapper array with different property names.

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Chromium**: Uses Manifest V3 with service workers
- **Firefox**: Uses Manifest V2 with background scripts
- Build system automatically copies correct manifest based on BROWSER environment variable

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development with watch mode
- `npm run dev:firefox` - Firefox-specific development
- `npm run dev:chromium` - Chromium-specific development
- `npm run build:firefox` - Firefox production build
- `npm run build:chromium` - Chromium production build
